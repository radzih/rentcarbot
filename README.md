# Car Rental Bot
This Telegram bot can help you to rent a car. Simply start a conversation with the bot, select a car from the list of available options, view its picture, and then press "Rent" to indicate your interest. Your message indicating that you want to rent a car will then be sent to a Telegram group, where the administrators can contact you to complete the rental process.

The bot also includes an admin panel built using Django, which allows you to manage users and add, remove, or update cars and their photos.
